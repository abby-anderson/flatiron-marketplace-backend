# Flatiron Marketplace
This is a straightforward marketplace website where users can post and delete items theyâ€™d like to sell as well as leave reviews on other items. 

## Architecture
This project was built with React.js on the frontend and Ruby, Sinatra, and Active Record on the backend. It was designed and developed through a fun collaborative process between myself, Sean Li, and Gabriel George, during our time at Flatiron School.

## Set up
To get this up and running in the backend, run: 

`bundle install`

`rake db:reset` (which will drop, migrate, and then re-seed the database)

`rake server`


Note: Since the backend and frontend are in different repositories for this project, you'll have to cd into the frontend project folder before moving forward with starting the react app. Once there, run:

`npm install`

`npm start`

And you're ready to get shopping!

### Final note
Please note that this is a work in progress! I will continue adding and improving features as I level up my skills. Feel free to share any comments or suggestions with me!
